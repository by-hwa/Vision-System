	and right camera under daylight illumunation. 1800 images per camera 
	in PNG format.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/depth_maps -> Ground truth depth maps for
	left and right camera. 1800 images per camera in OpenCV2 cv::Mat 
	format (XML). The units of each value is expressed in centimiters 
	(cm).

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/disparity_maps -> Ground truth disparity 
	maps for left and right camera. 1800 images per camera in PNG format.
	The disparity values have been quantized into the range [0,255].

The resolution of the images is 640x480 pixels, the baseline of the stereo 
camera is 10cm and the focal length of the camera is 615 pixels.
